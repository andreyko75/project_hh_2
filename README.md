 This is a ***training*** project from the [SkillFactory](https://skillfactory.ru/)  scholl, the purpose of which is to analyze the data on applicants provided by [HeadHunter](https://hh.ru/) and build a model that would automatically determine the approximate salary level suitable for the user, based on the information that he indicated about himself.
 
 **The project consists of 4 stages**

2. Data transformation

3. Exploratory data analysis.

4. Data cleaning

## What was used

- The original [template](https://lms.skillfactory.ru/assets/courseware/v1/1577d067038f8073197105c174f05822/asset-v1:SkillFactory+DST-3.0+28FEB2021+type@asset+block/Project-1._%D0%9D%D0%BE%D1%83%D1%82%D0%B1%D1%83%D0%BA-%D1%88%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BD.ipynb)
- Main jupiter notebook  as named **project_hh.ipynb**
